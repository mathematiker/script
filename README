=========
COMPILING
=========

Compile main.tex by using:

> make all

If you are editing the source code and you don't want the Makefile to rebuild
the index and the bibliography use

> make quick

or set your favourite LaTeX-Editor to the "LaTeX -> dvips -> ps2pdf" compilation
process and use your keyboard shortcuts.

Compiling with pdfLaTeX will fail.

Building was tested with TeXlive 2011 and TeXlive 2012.

===========
DEVELOPMENT
===========

This is a guide for people who want to contribute.
To do so please respect the following coding rules:

1. "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE":
---------------------------
Do not edit files containing the "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" header.
Pull requests containing changes to these files will be ignored.

2. Indentation:
---------------
Indent your code by two spaces. Avoid using tabs. If you still want to use
the tab key on your keyboard, set your editor to replace tabs with spaces.

3. Usage of \\:
---------------
Never use \\ inside of your text! Only use it when you have to (e.g. in
tables, equations). To begin a new paragraph just insert a blank line.

4. Code structure:
------------------
To make code more readable but to avoid randomly inserted space make use of
the % character. Use this on all equation-environments. Example:

Some text followed by an equation
%
\begin{equation}
  \int f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation}
%
Some more text.

5. Don't commit garbage files:
------------------------------
To not commit any files created by your favourite LaTeX-Editor, do a

> make distclean

before committing.

6. Never commit something you can't compile:
--------------------------------------------
This rule is pretty obvious, but there are still people out there ignoring this.
If your edits don't compile on your machine don't dare to send a pull request.
